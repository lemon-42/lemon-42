Hi everybody,

Just a lemon here, who like cybersec, and computer, things like this.

I don't know what i'm gonna post here, but we'll see. 

Currently i'm working on :

  - CyberSec in general (RedTeam weapon, OSINT, and some fundamentals)
  - Language C
  - A little bit of LFS
  - Some cybersec challenge.. Maybe we will release them one day (?)
  
I really hope to work in Cyber Security one day, i'll give my best for this tho.
